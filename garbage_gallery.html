        <div class="description"> <p>The Garbage Gallery Project is a process of collecting the non-organic rubbish and recycling I would usually discard over a set period of time. The process is about challenging the effects that distance and disposal would ordinarily have on my waste habits, forcing me to accept the immediacy and responsibility of my own waste. It serves as a tool for me to monitor what products I am consuming and later note how I could improve upon this.
