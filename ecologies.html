        <div class="description"> <p>Urban Ecologies seeks to strengthen my relationships to familiar urban environments and the entities within them through my sensory experiences in those places. Attentiveness, care and intuition guide the process, providing the foundation for ongoing growth.
            Within urban spaces such as my apartment, the art school, ÅŒwheo/Waters of Leith River and streets between, entities such as plants, birds, water, rubbish and urban geologies are drawn together in an interconnected system where each part may act as an entry point for further connections to be made. Installed as a room-sized web of fibres with videos and found objects embedded throughout, the assemblage sits somewhere between an ecological network and a mindmap. Whilst particular associations emerge from the web, ultimately these touch on the surface of an infinitely open system.
